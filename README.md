## üöÄ Features

- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection**:
  - Identifies critical issues like SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization, and insecure file handling.
  - Detects weak cryptographic algorithms such as MD5 and SHA1.

- **Multi-Language Support**:
  - Scans files written in PHP, HTML, and Python.

- **Detailed Reports**:
  - Generates an HTML report with a severity distribution chart and a table of detected vulnerabilities.

- **Fast and Efficient**:
  - Uses multithreading for fast directory scans.

- **Customizable Detection**:
  - Predefined detection rules that can be extended for specific use cases.

- **User-Friendly GUI**:
  - Built with `ttkbootstrap`, featuring a modern, responsive interface.

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dragonked2/Cyborg.git
   cd cyborg-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Then, install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Scanner**:
   ```bash
   python ve.py
   ```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

### GUI Mode:
1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python ve.py
   ```
2. Select either:
   - **Scan Single File**: Choose a specific file to scan.
   - **Scan Directory**: Select a folder to scan all files within it.
3. View the results in a detailed HTML report that opens automatically upon completion.

### Command-Line Mode (Planned Feature):
Future versions will support CLI commands for enhanced automation.

### üí° How to Create an EXE File for Easy Usage

You can convert the Cyborg Vulnerability Scanner into an executable file using **PyInstaller**, allowing you to run the tool without needing Python installed.

#### 1. **Install PyInstaller**
Ensure you have PyInstaller installed. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

#### 2. **Create the EXE File**
Use PyInstaller to compile the Python script into a standalone executable:

```bash
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole ve.py
```

- **`--onefile`**: Bundles everything into a single executable file.
- **`--noconsole`**: Hides the console window (useful for GUI applications).

#### 3. **Run the EXE**
Navigate to the `dist` folder where the EXE file is generated, and double-click `ve.exe` to launch the tool.

```plaintext
dist/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ve.exe
```

Enjoy a seamless experience with your standalone vulnerability scanner!

This version ensures clarity and highlights the simplicity of the process, making it easy for users to follow.

## üõ°Ô∏è Detection Rules

Cyborg Scanner uses a comprehensive set of detection rules to find vulnerabilities, including:

- **Input Handling**:
  - Unsanitized inputs (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`).
  - Unsafe cookies (`$_COOKIE`).

- **Code Execution**:
  - Dangerous functions like `eval`, `exec`, `shell_exec`.

- **File Operations**:
  - Potentially risky operations (`file_put_contents`, `fopen`, `unlink`).

- **Cryptography**:
  - Weak algorithms (e.g., `md5`, `sha1`).

- **Output Escaping**:
  - Unescaped user inputs in `echo` or `print`.

## üìú Example Output

Sample of detected vulnerabilities in the HTML report:

| File       | Line | Severity | Description                                | Code                     |
|------------|------|----------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `index.php` | 15   | Critical | Unsanitized input from `$_GET`.            | `echo $_GET['user'];`    |
| `script.py` | 32   | High     | Weak hashing algorithm `md5` detected.    | `hashed = md5(password)` |

The HTML report also includes a **severity distribution chart** for quick visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Extend Detection Rules
You can add new detection rules in the `DETECTION_RULES` list within `ve.py`. Each rule must include:
- `pattern`: Regex pattern to detect the vulnerability.
- `severity`: Severity level (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`).
- `description`: Explanation of the vulnerability.

Example:
```python
{"pattern": r"unsafe_function\s*\(", "severity": "Critical", "description": "Unsafe function detected. Avoid usage."}
```
